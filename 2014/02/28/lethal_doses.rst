Lethal Doses
============

A well known fact about alcohol, is that it should be consumed in reasonable
quantities. You probably have legal warning in advertisement for drinks in your
country. If that is of interest, you can have a look at `Health Warning Labels
<http://www.icap.org/table/HealthwarningLabels>`_ for various countries.

But that's not the point here, what I want to do, is to list the amount of some
common things we do intake regularly, and that can be lethal in higher
quantities, and try to relate it to the quantity of beverage or food we would
have to consume in order to reach this amount.

Obviously, this would have to be absorbed quite fast, as the body would try to
eliminate as much of it as fast as it can.

Remember that this are assumed lethal doses, serious problems will arise far
earlier! Please do not assume you can safely go to half of this without any
issues, plus all this is only theoretical.

Alcohol
-------

The generally admitted lethal dose is of 0.4% `Blood Alcohol Content
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content>`_.

It `seems
<http://www.alcohol.org.nz/alcohol-you/your-body-alcohol/health-effects/alcohol-poisoning>`_
that sums up from 5 to 8g per kilogram for an adult. So if we take the lower
limit, and a person weighting 60kg, this means 300g of alcohol.

- A bottle of Żubrówka is 700ml at 40% = 280g -> 1.07 bottles
- A bottle of red wine of 750ml, at 13% = 97.5g -> 3.07 bottles
- Beer in between at 6.5% in 33ml bottles = 2.145g -> 139 bottles

Caffeine
--------

In human, the dose is estimated to be 150 to 200mg per kilogram. For an average
adult, `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Caffeine_toxicity>`_
tells us that this means 80 to 100 cups of coffee.

That will obviously depends on the type an preparation of the coffee, but it
will still be quite hard to drink this much coffee in a short span of time. But
there are a lot of pills and candy with caffeine (some of you may know
`ThinkGeek's Food & Caffeine
<http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/food-caffeine/>`_ section), which may
take you to the danger zone faster.

Potassium
---------

As I earlier shared on G+, potassium can be lethal too, and common source of
potassium are bananas: everything is explained `right here
<http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/keep-asking/can-you-die-from-eating-too-many-bananas/>`_,
but to sum it up, you would need 195000mg of potassium, or about 487 bananas:
Good luck with that!

Vitamins 
--------

Ok, this one may not be one you'll have to worry too often about in your life,
but I love the fact that after all the "Eat your vegetables, you need your
vitamins!", we can die from too much of one of these vitamins.

Having too much of a given vitamin is known as `Hypervitaminosis
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_poisoning>`_ which you can apparently have
for vitamins A, D, E and maybe K.

- Vitamin A: Liver contains a lot of it, mostly in polar bear, seal, walrus,
  moose and husky. Polar bear are the most known about this because explorer of
  the Arctic regions came back with lot of illness due to it. Its toxicity
  levels are kind of `complex
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervitaminosis_A#Types_of_toxicity>`_.
- Vitamin D: It does seem that the only source to have more of it are supplement
  orally taken.
- Vitamin E: There is not much information about it... `Wikipedia page
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervitaminosis_E>`_ page is quite short, and
  there are not a lot of other sources online.

Unfortunately for the kids, you won't be able to tell your mom you've had enough
and she's putting you at risk, finish your plate of broccoli!

There are quite a lot, and I won't dive myself in all the drugs lethal doses,
but if you have more info, feel free to add information in the comments or on G+
