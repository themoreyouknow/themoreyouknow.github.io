<h1>Welcome to The More You Know</h1>
<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>The purpose of this website is to share some interesting things we can learn
online, no matter the subject, if it is worth knowing, it is worth sharing.</p>
<p>Like Buddha said:</p>
<p><strong>There is no wealth like knowledge, and no poverty like ignorance.</strong></p>
<p>So I hope this will be a good place to learn and share more things along the
way, let’s rock!</p>
